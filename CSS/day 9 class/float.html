            <p>Remembering Our Place in the Sacred Circle of Life Workshop with Christina Burress was life changing. Her multifaceted class exercises were thought provoking and engaging. I saw the world of nature and my connection with new eyes and a compassionate heart.  She held a sacred space for all to express and share. She listened deeply to our stories and written words and provided positive feedback. Christina's class offered me an opportunity to create a more intimate relationship with nature and myself.  I now have new tools in my toolbox to practice a more thoughtful and meaningful connection with the land I live on. – Jeanne
